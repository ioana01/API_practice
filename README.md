# API_practice

I created an app in which multiple APIs are being used:
  - OpenWeather API to get information about the weather of a city introduced in a search bar by the user
  - Autocomplete Google API to give the user suggestions of places based on what is already written in the search field
  - Geolocation Google API - There is a "Use current location on the page". When clicked, the named API is used to get the user's location and in combination with the first API mentioned, the user gets the weather information in his location.
